Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costners character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutchers ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.\\'\\n \\'This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, theres really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, whove each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Dont bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-Ts horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and Im still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this film? And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? From Aliens onward, every film Ive seen with Bill Paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...Overall, this is second-rate action trash. There are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgement Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.\\'\\n \\'First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who couldnt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clichÃ©e version of gangsters.The movie doesnt take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before were already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. I didnt like him right from the start.The movie is filled with pointless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no-one. Everybody dies, except from Paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve.The only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but theyre actors by profession, not annoying ugly brain dead rappers.Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. At lest they have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.\\'\\n ...\\n \\'I am amazed at how this movieand most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I dont see how since most of Fuquas movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story: Alvin SandersJamie Foxx is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent EdgarDavid Morse as a pawn to catch a killer named BristolDoug Hutchinson. Alvins every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvins brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldnt look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasnt checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... How long have you been living under a rock? Im pretty sure youve seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But those movies arent violent right? Weirdo.\\'\\n \\'A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but Ive been raised on John Denver and the songs from this special were always my familys Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track down a video of it on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for some 21 years, I got to see John and the Muppets in action for myself. If you ever get the chance, its a lot of fun--great music, heart-warming and cheesy. Its also interesting to see the 70s versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe Denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--I guess normally performers dont compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the Muppets, but Im glad he did. Even if you cant track down the video, the soundtrack is worth it too. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original Denver tunes as well.\\'\\n \\'Working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro both terrific. Shes a widow who cant move on, hes illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Barkers novel \"Union Street\" a better title! is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the films editing is a mess, but its still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy. There are no overtures to serious issues even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree. The finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldnt really be satisfying any other way.  from\\'] not found in axis'",

Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costners character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutchers ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.\\'\\n \\'This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, theres really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, whove each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Dont bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-Ts horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and Im still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this film? And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? From Aliens onward, every film Ive seen with Bill Paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...Overall, this is second-rate action trash. There are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgement Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.\\'\\n \\'First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who couldnt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clichÃ©e version of gangsters.The movie doesnt take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before were already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. I didnt like him right from the start.The movie is filled with pointless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no-one. Everybody dies, except from Paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve.The only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but theyre actors by profession, not annoying ugly brain dead rappers.Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. At lest they have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.\\'\\n ...\\n \\'I am amazed at how this movieand most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I dont see how since most of Fuquas movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story: Alvin SandersJamie Foxx is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent EdgarDavid Morse as a pawn to catch a killer named BristolDoug Hutchinson. Alvins every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvins brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldnt look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasnt checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... How long have you been living under a rock? Im pretty sure youve seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But those movies arent violent right? Weirdo.\\'\\n \\'A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but Ive been raised on John Denver and the songs from this special were always my familys Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track down a video of it on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for some 21 years, I got to see John and the Muppets in action for myself. If you ever get the chance, its a lot of fun--great music, heart-warming and cheesy. Its also interesting to see the 70s versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe Denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--I guess normally performers dont compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the Muppets, but Im glad he did. Even if you cant track down the video, the soundtrack is worth it too. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original Denver tunes as well.\\'\\n \\'Working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro both terrific. Shes a widow who cant move on, hes illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Barkers novel \"Union Street\" a better title! is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the films editing is a mess, but its still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy. There are no overtures to serious issues even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree. The finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldnt really be satisfying any other way.  from\\'] not found in axis'"
